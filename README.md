## Description:
This website is designed using HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and Parse which is an online database. Eclipse Mars is used to put everything together. HTML is used to create the main structure of the website, such as were things will be placed. JavaScript and jQuery are used create all of the functions and make API calls. CSS is used to style the look of the page. And Parse is used store users information such as username, email, password, and cart items. API’s and Website Crawler to extract information from the stores’ site.
A website called import.io is used to crawl the wanted website. API is used with Walmart because it is available for all developers. On the other hand, Target only allow their associates to use their API, therefore crawling the website is used. BestBuy have their own API and it is available for all developer. But there was a problem with their search functionality. It wasn’t accurate at all. In order to make it accurate you have to add the category ID and other descriptions to narrow the search. So instead, web crawler is used to extract the information.
